Hyperledger Aries Framework Go enables trusted communication and data exchange based on interoperable distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) interactions.
We provide a flexible toolkit to enable the usage of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID-to-DID communications, verifiable credential exchange, transaction authorizations, and data communication protocols. From these building blocks, implementors can build agents, mediators and other DIDComm features in a manner that is agnostic to a particular DID network or governance framework.

We aim to provide Go implementations of:

- Decentralized identity standards including [W3C decentralized identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) (DIDs), [W3C DID resolution](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/), and [W3C verifiable credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/).
- Decentralized data communication protocols anchored in DIDs: [DIDComm](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm).
- A pluggable dependency framework, where implementors can customize primitives via Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs). We have a "batteries included" model where default primitives are included -- such as a key management system (KMS), crypto, data storage, digital hub integration, etc.

We aim to enable usage of our protocol implementations in a wide variety of edge and cloud environments including servers, browsers, mobile, and devices.
API bindings are supplied to enable these environments including:

- Go
- REST
- C (future)
- WebAssembly (future)

We implement demonstrations and test cases, that require a ledger system, using [DIF Sidetree protocol](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) as this protocol enables generic decentralized ledger systems to operate as a DID network.

## Build
### Prerequisites (General)
- Go 1.13

### Prerequisites (for running tests and demos)
- Go 1.13
- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Make

### Targets
```
# run all the project build targets
make all

# run linter checks
make checks

# run unit tests
make unit-test
```

### Running bdd tests
Instructions for running the bdd tests can be [found here](docs/test/bdd_instructions.md).

### Running demo locally
Instructions for running the OpenAPI demo can be [found here](docs/demo/openapi_demo_instructions.md).

### Controller REST API specifications generation
Controller REST API specifications are generated according to Open API 2.0 standards.

It can be generated by running command `make generate-openapi-test`

Generated spec can be found under 
`build/rest/openapi/spec`

### Crypto material generation for tests
For unit-tests, crypto material is generated under:

`pkg/didcomm/transport/http/testdata`

using the `openssl` tool. 

It is generated automatically when running unit tests. 

If you wish to regenerate it, you can delete this folder and:
1. run `make unit-test`
 or
2. cd into `pkg/didcomm/transport/http/` and run `go generate`

### Verifiable Credential Test Suite
To test compatibility of the verifiable credential packages with 
[W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group Test Suite](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite), run `make vc-test-suite`.
The result of the test suite is generated as `vc-test-suite/suite/implementations/aries-framework-go-report.json`.

### Documentation

Agent documentation can be viewed at [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go).

The packages intended for end developer usage are within the pkg/client folder along with the main agent package (pkg/framework/aries).
