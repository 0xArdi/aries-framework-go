## Introduction
A Go framework for Aries

## Build
##### Prerequisites (General)
- Go 1.13

##### Prerequisites (for running tests and demos)
- Go 1.13
- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Make

##### Targets
```
# run all the project build targets
make all

# run linter checks
make checks

# run unit tests
make unit-test
```
##### Running demo locally
The demo is to play around with APIs using the OpenAPI (Swagger) user interface and JSON.

The demo can be launched by `make run-openapi-demo`
This target will start Alice and Bob demo agent containers. Once started, OpenAPI user interface for agents can be accessed using below URLs.

[Alice agent OpenAPI user interface](http://localhost:8089/openapi/)

[Bob agent OpenAPI user interface](http://localhost:9089/openapi/),

##### Crypto material generation for tests
For unit-tests, crypto material is generated under:

`pkg/didcomm/transport/http/testdata`

using the `openssl` tool. 

It is generated automatically when running unit tests. 

If you wish to regenerate it, you can delete this folder and:
1. run `make unit-test`
 or
2. cd into `pkg/didcomm/transport/http/` and run `go generate`

##### Controller REST API specifications generation
Controller REST API specifications are generated according to Open API 2.0 standards.

It can be generated by running command `make generate-openapi-test`

Generated spec can be found under 
`build/rest/openapi/spec`

##### Verifiable Credential Test Suite
To test compatibility of the verifiable credential packages with 
[W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group Test Suite](https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite), run `make vc-test-suite`.
The result of the test suite is generated as `vc-test-suite/suite/implementations/aries-framework-go-report.json`.
