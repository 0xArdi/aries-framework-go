### Verifiable Credential

A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents. It is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.
Examples of verifiable credentials include digital employee identification cards, digital birth certificates, and digital educational certificates.
